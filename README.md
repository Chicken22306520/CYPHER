# CYPHER
This Python script is designed to perform a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, a malicious act that overwhelms a target server or network by flooding it with a massive volume of traffic.
**Description:**
The provided Python script is designed to conduct a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on a target IP address and port. DDoS attacks overwhelm a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering the target inaccessible to legitimate users. This script uses UDP packets to flood the target with a large volume of data, potentially causing the target server or network to become unresponsive.

**Disclaimer:**
This script is intended purely for educational purposes to understand how DDoS attacks work and how to defend against them. Unauthorized use of this script to launch DDoS attacks on any network or website is illegal and unethical. The author and the platform do not condone or promote any illegal activities, including DDoS attacks. Use this script responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission to conduct testing.

**What is a DDoS Attack?**
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of incoming traffic. DDoS attacks are often executed using a large number of compromised devices (a botnet) to generate the massive traffic volume required to overwhelm the target.

**How to Use and Download (Not Recommended):**
To download and use this script, follow these steps:
1. **Download the Script:**
   - Open a terminal window on your computer.
   - Use the `wget` command to download the script. For example:

     ```
2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script by typing `python ddos_script.py` in the terminal.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the target IP address, port, attack duration, and total runtime of the script.
   - The script will start launching DDoS attacks on the specified target.

**Important Note:**
Please understand that this script is provided for educational purposes only. Using this script without explicit permission to perform DDoS attacks is illegal and unethical. Engaging in such activities can result in severe legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment. Always adhere to the laws and ethical guidelines of your country and the internet community.
